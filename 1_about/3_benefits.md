# Benefits

- Simplified Infrastructure: DOSIOS can simplify network infrastructure by consolidating multiple network functions onto a single platform. This reduces the need for multiple hardware devices and simplifies network management.
- Cost Savings: DOSIOS can reduce costs associated with hardware, installation, and maintenance, as well as reduce power consumption and physical space requirements.
- Rapid Deployment: DOSIOS can be rapidly deployed at customer premises, allowing for faster provisioning of network services. This can help to reduce the time required to deploy new services or make changes to existing services, which can improve the time-to-market for new offerings.
- Centralized  and remote Management: DOSIOS can be managed via centralized platform for managing network services, making it easier to configure and deploy new services across multiple customer sites. This can help to reduce the time required to deploy new services, as well as reduce the risk of configuration errors. DOSIOS can be remotely managed, allowing administrators to configure and manage network services without the need for on-site visits. This can help to reduce the time required for service deployment, as well as reduce the costs associated with on-site visits.
- Automation: DOSIOS supports network automation, allowing administrators to automate the process of configuring and deploying network services. This can help to reduce the time required for service deployment, as well as reduce the risk of configuration errors.
