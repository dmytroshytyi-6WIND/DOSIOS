# Configuration types and (supported)/(not_supported) commands

Configuration may be done via the CREATE, DELETE, CHANGE operations. Some of them supported more than anothers in current version.

## CREATE

Most of creation commands except "cvlans" work as expected:

```
"cvlans" accepts only 1 cVLAN.
```

## DELETE

MOST of deletion commands work as expected with reserve that CHANGES commands were not used.


## CHANGE

This operation is a bit touchy. Some code modification currently under revision to support mode commands with CHANGE operation. 

```
CHANGE set ecp switches sw ports port X vm+port             => success 
CHANGE set ecp switches sw ports port X vm port1 -> port2   => success
CHANGE set ecp switches sw ports port X port-mode           => success 
CHANGE set ecp switches sw ports port X tag                 => success 
CHANGE set ecp switches sw ports port X stacked-mode        => success 
CHANGE set ecp switches sw ports port X n-txq               => success 
CHANGE set ecp switches sw ports port X n-rxq               => success 
CHANGE set ecp switches sw ports port X interface           => success
