# Overview

Distributed Open Software Infrastructure Operating System, or DOSIOS, is a powerful and flexible operating system that is designed to meet the needs of modern network infrastructures. 
With DOSIOS, you can easily create and deploy service functions, chain them together with virtual switches, and connect them to the physical ports of your network equipment.

One of the strong sides of DOSIOS is its support for the Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK), which allows for accelerated packet exchange and improved performance.
This means that your network can handle high volumes of traffic with ease, and can quickly and efficiently process data packets as they move through your network.

Another important aspect of DOSIOS is its support for the NETCONF protocol and YANG modelisation language.
This allows for easy management of your network infrastructure, and provides a standardized way to configure and manage network devices.

With DOSIOS, you can quickly and easily perform identification and physical port mapping during the initial setup phase, using the provided toolkits.
Additionally, DOSIOS allows you to set the parameters of your service function deployment, including CPU, RAM, IFs, and disks.
You can also configure your virtual switches with a range of options, including trunk, access, tag, and stacked VLANs.
This gives you complete control over your network infrastructure, and allows you to customize it to meet your specific needs and requirements.

In summary, DOSIOS is a powerful and flexible operating system that provides a range of tools and features for managing and deploying network services.
Whether you're a network administrator, an operator, a developer, or a system integrator, DOSIOS provides the tools you need to create a robust and scalable network infrastructure that can handle even the most demanding workloads.
